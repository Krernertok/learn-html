Learn HTML
==========

This repository contains the source code for my first web application, Learn HTML, which is used for learning all valid HTML5 tags. The goal of this project is to become acquainted with creating a simple web application using front-end and back-end technologies as well as basic UI/visual/web design.

The project is still very much a work in progress.

The application is based on the _Flasky_ application used in _Flask Web Development_ by Miguel Grinberg.


Future features:
- Improve usability, e.g. through better layouts
- Front-end validation
- Visualizations of stats using D3.js


Technologies used:
- HTML / CSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Flask + extensions
- SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- D3.js (planned)
