Learn HTML
==========

This repository contains the source code for my first web application, Learn HTML, which is used for learning all valid HTML5 tags. The goal of this project is to become acquainted with creating a simple web application using front-end and back-end technologies as well as basic UI/visual/web design.

The application is based on the _Flasky_ application used in _Flask Web Development_ by Miguel Grinberg.

Planned features:
- Registering new users
- Logging in and out
- "Stats" page for tracking progress

Future features:
- Improve usability through better layouts
- Visualizations of stats using D3.js


Technologies used:
- HTML / CSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Flask + extensions
- SQLAlchemy + SQLite (planned)
- D3.js (planned)
